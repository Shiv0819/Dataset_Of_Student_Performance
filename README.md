Database_of_Student_performance. This project is designed to create the necessary database tables for managing student information. It tracks which teacher teaches which student and subject, monitors student performance through weekly attendance and test results, and identifies the top-performing student each week.

The student who achieves the highest marks in the weekly test will be considered for first priority in job placements. All required details and logic are implemented directly within the provided code.
